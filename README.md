** Summaries and Opinions **
Oriana Wai: I mostly worked on the special project problems and exercises. I
felt that the puzzles you came up with in your special project were creative and
engaging. I actually had a lot of fun with the ones I did. I think, as a group,
we divvied up the work and worked together really well.

Peter Oien:

Astrid Vargas:

Justin Parry: I worked a little on the puzzles and got some traction on the
second, but then prioritized our special project and helped Jonathon with the
Beast 2.0. I feel like the special project was left too open-ended and not
specific. Also the workload looks innocent and appropriate at first but the time
required to do a little is much more than expected for this class.
